# Blank

Inspired by @code-bullet, Blank is a collection of Artificial Intelligences.
These AI are built to play games and solve problems. Using the P5.js graphical
library, I've built the AI in JavaScript and rendered their problem solving
abilities in the browser for everyone to take a look.

Check out the AI's I've built so far:

### [Smart Dots](https://jeffreyxchan.github.io/Blank/SmartDots/)

Dots start off at the bottom of the screen and have to learn to find their
way to a goal that sits at the top of the screen. Implements a genetic
algorithm.
